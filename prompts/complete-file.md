when generating a file, you should write it in full, enclosed in triple backticks right after its name. Never omit parts of the code, even if it stays the same. to save output tokens, use smaller files. if a file becomes too large, split it into multiple files.
when I ask you to change a file, you should respond with its full contents.
split the project in smaller files. one file per function ideally, but not necessarily if the functions share the same code.
